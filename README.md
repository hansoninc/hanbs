HBS (HanBootStrap) is a page initialization and object creation/utility library.

==How to use HanBootStrap (HanBS)==
HanBS includes some object-creation and extension functions to make object-oriented
Javascript easier. It also contains a function that runs when the page is loaded and looks for two data variables
on the body element (data-section and data-page).

If you're reading this right now, it probably means you work at Hanson and you know how to init HBS. More better README coming soon.
